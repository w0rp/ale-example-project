# ALE Example Project

This project demonstrates how ALE works. To get project running, do the
following.

1. Install Vim 8 or a recent NeoVim version.
2. Install [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale).
3. Run `./install.sh`. (`yarn` and `python3.6` must be installed)
4. Edit `test.py` or `test.ts` and play around.

You can clean the project with simply `git clean -fdx`.
